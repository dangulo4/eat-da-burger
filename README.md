# Eat Da Burger

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm.svg?style=flat)]

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Description

- The application will create an application for a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
